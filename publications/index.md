We conduct research to bridge the gap between life sciences and computer science, employing advanced sequencing technologies to analyze (meta-)genomic and transcriptomic datasets related to infectious diseases, immunology, and medical sciences. With this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to improve our understanding of pathogen-host interactions and support genomic surveillance and containment. We perform research in the following areas:

* Microbial bioinformatics
* Genomic surveillance
* Pathogen detection and characterization
* Nanopore real-time sequencing
* Transcriptomics and gene expression
* Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics
* Reproducible genomics (container, WMS)
