Valentina Galeone is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics & Translational Research Team. She completed her Bachelor’s degree in Genomics at the University of Bologna and her Master’s degree in Bioinformatics at the Free University of Berlin.

Her research focuses on bioinformatics methods for the analysis of Nanopore sequencing data, including basecalling, genome assembly, and in particular methylation detection in bacterial samples. She has developed a Nextflow pipeline for methylation detection and her current research direction involves applying machine learning approaches to analyze methylation patterns in reads from bacterial isolates and metagenomic samples.
