My journey at the Robert Koch Institute began in 2020 as a student assistant while pursuing my degrees in bioinformatics. Now, as a bioinformatician in the Bioinformatics and Translational Research team, I specialize in metagenomics and antimicrobial resistance screening within the Wastewater-Program. This role leverages my foundational expertise I have build over the past years at the RKI and during my studies in software- and pipeline development, bacterial genomics, metagenomics, and microbiomics and general data analysis. I also contribute significantly to the development of pathogen-specific AMR pipelines in cooperation with multiple epidemiologists for the Integrated Genomic Surveillance Program (IGS) of Germany and facilitate workshops on bacterial genomics.

Having completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees with the RKI, I've seamlessly integrated my educational background into my professional role. Outside of my work, I am passionate about sports and enjoy spending time in the woods.
