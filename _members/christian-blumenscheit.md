I am a microbiologist with a strong interest in data analysis and have taught myself bioinformatics. Today I regularly work with tools such as R and Python and develop workflows for processing and analysing NGS and MS data. My aim is to accurately evaluate complex data and present results in a way that is understandable to scientific and clinical partners.

In my previous research, I have worked extensively on the identification of multidrug resistant bacteria using genomic and proteomic approaches. This work has not only broadened my technical knowledge, but has also given me valuable experience in interdisciplinary collaboration and data-driven problem solving.

Through my microbiology training and independent training in bioinformatics, I have developed a particular ability to combine biological questions with data-driven methods. This combination of theory, practice and technical know-how drives me to develop innovative solutions and implement them in a team.
