I am Hugues, a Senior Researcher and Principal Investigator in the BTR team. I have a strong background in statistics and computational biology. I have been an Associate Professor at Sorbonne University since 2009 (Computer Science and Engineering dept, currently on leave). My research focuses on statistical methods for high-throughput sequencing data and computational genomics. My recent projects include creating tools for analyzing large-scale transcriptomic and metagenomics data, the analysis of bacterial pangenomes, and developing algorithms for the genomics of transplantation and the molecular diagnostics of pathogens. You can find some information on my former [webpage](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/hrichard/index.html) or have a look at my [CV](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/hrichard/cv_richard.pdf)
