After graduating from FU Berlin in Bioinformatics and Data Science, I started as a a PhD student at the Center of Artificial Intelligence in Public Health Research and the Bioinformatics & Translational Research Team.

During my Bachelors thesis I focused on structural bioinformatics and computer-aided drug design. For my Masters thesis project, I switched to wastewater-based epidemiology and worked on a bioinformatic method for identifying and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 lineages from wastewater sequencing data.

Now, during my PhD, I am continuing my wastewater-based research and explore how AI methods can be utilized to assist wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.
