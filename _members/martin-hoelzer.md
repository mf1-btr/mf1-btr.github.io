I am a researcher and team lead at the [Genome Competence Center](https://www.rki.de/EN/Institute/Organisation/Departments/MFI/MF1/mf1-genome-competence-centre-node.html) of the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN) (RKI) in Berlin, Germany. We study infectious diseases in a One Health context by applying real-time nanopore sequencing, pangenomics approaches, analyzing environmental samples such as wastewater, and studying microbial evolution using bioinformatics for genomic surveillance.

I studied Bioinformatics at the University of Jena, Germany (FSU) and achieved my PhD by specializing in RNA Bioinformatics and High-Throughput Analysis. Following this, I joined the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Hinxton (UK) to work in Microbiome Informatics. Since 2020, I have continued my academic journey at the RKI, the national institute for public health in Germany, conducting research with my team and (inter)national colleagues in microbial bioinformatics,  genomic surveillance, pathogen detection and characterization, nanopore real-time sequencing, transcriptomics and gene expression, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, methylation detection in prokaryotes, and reproducible genomics (container, WMS).
