I'm Martin, a researcher and team lead at the [Genome Competence Center](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/MF/MF1/mf1_node.html) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany. We study infectious diseases in a One Health context by applying real-time nanopore sequencing, pangenomics approaches, analyzing environmental samples such as wastewater, and studying microbial evolution using bioinformatics for genomic surveillance.

I studied Bioinformatics at the University of Jena, Germany (FSU) and achieved my PhD by specializing in RNA Bioinformatics and High-Throughput Analysis. Following this, I moved to the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Hinxton (UK) to work in Microbiome Informatics. Since 2020, I have continued my academic journey at the RKI in Berlin, the national institute for public health in Germany, conducting research with my team and (inter)national colleagues in microbial bioinformatics,  genomic surveillance, pathogen detection and characterization, nanopore real-time sequencing, transcriptomics and gene expression, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and reproducible genomics (container, WMS).

I'm Martin, a bioinformatician with a rich background in sequencing data analysis, currently leading the "Research & Innovation" team within the [Genome Competence Center (MF1)](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/MF/MF1/mf1_node.html) at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany. I earned my PhD working on "The Dark Art of Next-Generation Sequencing: fundamental approaches for genomics, transcriptomics, and differential gene expression" at the University of Jena in 2018 ([thesis](https://github.com/hoelzer/phd-thesis/blob/main/2017-phd-thesis-FSU-dark-art-martin-hoelzer.pdf)). During my postdoc, I worked on real-time long-read sequencing and its application in metagenomics and virus detection, e.g. in [groundwater](https://www.aquadiva.uni-jena.de/). I continued to deepen my knowledge of nanopore metagenomics and pathogen detection as a visiting scientist in the [Microbiome Informatics group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/teams/microbiome-informatics) at the EBI in Hinxton, UK. 

In 2020, I moved to the RKI, where I previously worked as deputy head of the Bioinformatics unit, and conducted research in the areas of real-time nanopore sequencing, pipeline development, and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. With the establishment of the Genome Competence Center (MF1) at RKI in March 2023, I've taken the helm of the "Research & Innovation" team, guiding our interdisciplinary group in leveraging technology platforms and data analysis to forge new paths in experimental and bioinformatics approaches for cutting-edge research and applications.

<!--My research interests are vast, delving into transcriptomics & comparative genomics, _de novo_ assembly & annotation, and metagenomics & metatranscriptomics. A strong advocate for automation, I'm dedicated to creating user-friendly tools that facilitate researchers in getting biological insights, with a keen focus on workflow management systems and containerization to enhance our capabilities.

My team aims to bridge the gap between life sciences and computer science, employing advanced sequencing technologies to analyze (meta-)genomic and transcriptomic datasets related to infectious diseases, immunology, and medical sciences. This interdisciplinary approach has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of pathogen-host interactions and in supporting pandemic surveillance and containment efforts.-->
