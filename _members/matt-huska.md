I'm Matt Huska, a computational biologist dedicated to unraveling the mysteries embedded within genetic code and the developent of open source tools to further this goal. My research spans diverse areas, from delving into human epigenetics and epigenetics using high-throughput sequencing data and machine learning, to developing software to improve tumor evolution inference and more recently creating high speed open source tools for the identification of putative infection chains using SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. With a solid foundation in statistical analysis and machine learning, coupled with a passion for addressing real-world challenges, I am driven to push the boundaries of bioinformatics and make meaningful contributions to scientific understanding and human health.
