# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

We believe in creating a diverse environment with an open and inclusive culture where everyone feels welcomed, heard, and valued. All team members can bring their authentic selves to work and be who they are, wherever they are. We emphasize training and teaching the future generation of bioinformaticians by lecturing, participating in workshops, and mentoring students at all grade levels. The team includes senior scientists, postdocs, and students at all levels.

We work closely with the other teams at the [Genome Competence Center](https://www.rki.de/EN/Institute/Organisation/Departments/MFI/MF1/mf1-genome-competence-centre-node.html) on various cross-sectional projects.
